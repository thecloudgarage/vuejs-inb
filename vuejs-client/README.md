# Weighter Vue

After creating a completely server side weight tracking app ([weighter](https://github.com/bradgarropy/weighter)), it was time to begin learning the multitude of front end javascript frameworks.

I learned [React](https://reactjs.org/) first by recreating the [weighter](https://github.com/bradgarropy/weighter) application, aptly named [weighter-react](https://github.com/bradgarropy/weighter-react). Then I moved on to doing the same thing with [Vue](https://vuejs.org/). Picking up [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) was so much easier, mostly because I already understood the client side workflow. But more than just that, [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) seemed to make more sense to me. It's file structure and HTML directives made more sense to me than [React](https://reactjs.org/)'s pure JS/JSX implementation. I also loved how [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) has an officially supported router and http package, where [React](https://reactjs.org/) made you go searching.

The only downside I current see to [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) is that it lacks a well developed Native library, which is imperative for developing any type of application nowadays.
