# Weighter API

After creating a completely server side weight tracking app ([weighter](https://github.com/bradgarropy/weighter)), it was time to implement a client side front end, which means I also needed a REST API on the server side. Using my [NWA Template](https://github.com/bradgarropy/nwa) as a starting point, I was able to quickly spin up some user and weight models. This API acts as the backend to both the [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) implementations of the front end.

Both implementations are deployed on [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps) at the links below:  
http://weighter-react.herokuapp.com/  
http://weighter-vue.herokuapp.com/  

You can access the API here:
